# Spacemacs Config

Spacemacs team usually recommends using the macport distribution of emacs because it allows
for proper rendering of fancy modeline separators. While the fancy separators are nice I think
the official emacs distribution is more stable and responsive. Personally, I'll take that over
fancy modeline things. I use this homebrew command to install emacs:

`brew install emacs --with-cocoa --with-librsvg --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick`
